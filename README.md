Build and tested on Ubuntu 19.04
!!! Sorted out GEM build issues and dependancy problems !!!

# How to install:

In folder installers run 

* **Ubuntu**: ```$ sudo ./ubuntu_setup.sh ```

# How to use:

This is a big smash up of a lot of various tools I have made in the past along with some new ones. It includes a array of tools for helping with pentesting and messing around on the net. Currently only have installer files made for Ubuntu &amp; systems, but if you know what you're doing you can easily read them and get what you need to get all the dependencies installed on your own.

I made a quick basic demonstration video you to give a general overview of what it has included, you can watch it here:
